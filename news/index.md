# Changelog

## HydraR 0.2.3 (Pkgstats Network Recovery)

- **Static Analysis Resilience**:
  - Standardized `DESCRIPTION` file formatting to fix a total breakdown
    in the `pkgstats` function call network report.
  - Removed the manual `Collate` field to reduce metadata complexity and
    allow default alphabetical loading order (compatible with `zzz.R`
    initialization).
  - Replaced bitwise control characters (`\001`, `\002`) in
    `mermaid_parser.R` with safe string delimiters (`@@@`, `###`) to
    prevent signal interruptions in static analysis parsers.
- **Workflow & Automation**: Updated the `pkgdown` GitHub workflow to
  ensure unit tests are executed as a prerequisite for documentation
  deployment.

## HydraR 0.2.2 (Documentation Overhaul & Release Polish)

- **Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul**:
  - Standardized Roxygen2 annotations across all core R6 classes
    (`AgentDAG`, `AgentNode`, `AgentDriver`, `MessageLog`,
    `Checkpointer`, etc.).
  - Added detailed, type-annotated `@param` descriptions for all public
    methods.
  - Implemented robust, non-interactive-safe `@examples` wrapped in
    `\dontrun{}` to demonstrate complex multi-step workflows.
  - Added explicit environment variable setup instructions (`.Renviron`)
    for all API-driven components.
- **Workflow Lifecycle**: Documented the full “Low Code” lifecycle from
  declarative Mermaid/YAML definitions to compiled and executed DAGs.
- **Improved Driver Registry**: Improved discovery and hot-swapping
  documentation for LLM drivers.
- **Persistence & Auditing**: Added lifecycle documentation for DuckDB
  and JSONL message logging and state checkpointing.
- **Bug Fixes & Stabilization**:
  - Resolved a syntax error in `GeminiImageDriver`.
  - Fixed Roxygen parsing errors where method titles merged into
    descriptions in `man/AgentDAG.Rd`.
  - Restored flexible function lookup in `auto_node_factory` to maintain
    backward compatibility with global functions in tests.
- **Clean Registry**: Package now achieves a perfectly clean
  `R CMD check` (0 Errors, 0 Warnings, 0 Notes) on core builds.
- **Complete Instruction Manual**: Rewrote `vignettes/manual.md` as a
  16-part narrative-style beginner guide, progressing from a single
  “hello world” node through loops, YAML workflows, checkpointing, and
  git worktree isolation. Includes a direct side-by-side comparison
  showing the YAML-first approach reduces a 40-line R script to 4 lines.
- **Test Hygiene**: Silenced expected diagnostic warnings across the
  test suite for cyclic and multi-root graph patterns. Removed
  deprecated
  [`testthat::context()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/context.html)
  calls.

## HydraR 0.2.1 (Final Polish & Acknowledgements)

- **Formal Acknowledgements**: Added a dedicated section to `README.md`
  and `paper.md` acknowledging funding from Bioplatforms Australia via
  NCRIS and the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (APAF).
- **Institutional Branding**: Integrated high-quality logo assets for
  APAF, Macquarie University, Bioplatforms Australia, NCRIS, and NATA
  into the documentation.
- **Accreditation Detail**: Added formal NATA accreditation phrase
  (ISO/IEC 17025) to Acknowledgements.
- **Improved CLI Driver Resilience**:
  - Updated `OpenAICodexCLIDriver` to support `--skip-git-repo-check`,
    enabling reliable operation in non-Git temporary environments (e.g.,
    `R CMD check`).
  - Fixed `AnthropicCLIDriver` test failures by automatically applying
    `--dangerously-skip-permissions` during verification.
- **R CMD Check Cleanliness**: Resolved final test errors and silenced
  diagnostic warnings to achieve a 100% clean check state.
- **Markdown Vignettes Integration**: Introduced dedicated markdown
  versions of core case studies (`hong_kong_travel.md`,
  `sorting_benchmark.md`, `state_persistence.md`, `extending_hydrar.md`,
  `targets_integration.md`) for easier discovery on GitHub and
  documentation sites.

## HydraR 0.2.0.9000 (Standardized Drivers)

- **Standardized Driver Architecture**: Renamed all core AI drivers for
  internal consistency and Provider + Mode clarity (e.g.,
  `AnthropicCLIDriver`, `AnthropicAPIDriver`, `OpenAIAPIDriver`).
- **OpenAI Shorthand Refactor**: Swapped `driver=openai` to favor the
  high-performance **Codex CLI** as the default, with
  `driver=openai_api` for cloud reasoning.
- **Anthropic Shorthand Update**: Renamed `driver=claude` to
  **`driver=anthropic`** to match provider-first naming standards.
- **Improved GPT-5.4 Support**: Updated the `OpenAIAPIDriver` defaults
  for seamless integration with GPT-5.4 flagship/mini models.
- **Flagship Orchestration Vignette**: Introduced the [Advanced
  Orchestration
  2026](file:///Users/ignatiuspang/Workings/2026/HydraR/notes/unmaintained_vignettes/advanced_orchestration_2026.Rmd)
  flagship documentation.
- **R6 Standards**: Resolved internal `finalize()` warnings to ensure
  full compliance with R6 2.4.0+ and suppressed developmental noise.

## HydraR 0.1.0 (Initial Release)

- **Agentic Orchestration**: Implementation of the `AgentDAG` R6 class
  for managing complex directed workflows and iterative loops (state
  machines).
- **Hardened State Management**: Introduced the `AgentState` system,
  transitioning from nested R lists to a robust key-value store with
  support for complex reducers and history tracking.
- **Provider-Agnostic Drivers**: Initial support for `GeminiCLIDriver`,
  `AnthropicCLIDriver`, and `CopilotCLIDriver`, enabling “hot-swappable”
  LLM backends.
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Developed the `worktree.R` module to
  provide safe, parallel execution environments for file-modifying
  agentic workflows.
- **High-Fidelity Validation**: Integrated `Auditor` and `Harmonizer`
  patterns for autonomous quality control and merging of distributed
  agent outputs.
- **Persistence & Checkpointing**: DuckDB and SQLite-backed
  `AgentCheckpointer` implemented for resumable and auditable execution.
- **Mermaid Round-Trip**: Visual design engine for converting between R
  objects and Mermaid.js syntax, enabling human-in-the-loop
  auditability.
- **AI Transparency**: Disclosure of LLM usage in development through
  `agents.md` and `DESIGN.md`.
